Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a financial company that wishes to add additional security and then maintaining it to provide the best possible security for their customers.

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
I did well with making sure that all of the vulnerabilites were accounted for and coming up with the best way to counteract them. Secure coding is vitally important because it provides a customer with the sense that 
their information will be kept safe and secure. A company with good security will allow them to maintain their client's trust and to add new client's to their clientel, which in turn is good for their bottom line.

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
I think the most helpful tool was the dependency check, it layed out in detail every vulnerability that could have been overlooked.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
Testing the vulnerabilities allowed me to address the vulnerabilities directly in the code and provided me with a sense that you will be able to edit those vulnerabilities in the code at any point to maintain the 
security of the company.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
Continually testing and debugging the code allowed me to find if the application was functional and secure. After refactoring the code, I would run antoher dependency check to ensure that there were no new
vulnerabilites.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
If I had a question about something during project, I would use google to try and find a solution. If that didn't work I would ask someone with more experience their thoughts on the problem, and then brainstorm the 
best way to proceed.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would show them my use of the hash function on how I sent encrypted communications.
